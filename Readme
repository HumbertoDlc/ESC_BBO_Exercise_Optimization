This repository contains 3 directories: "Human_Model_ESC", "Human_Model_BBO", and "ESC_BBO_RESULTS".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory "Human_Model_ESC" contains the required files to run the optimization program by using ESC.

By default, it can be performed by simply running the script "FCN_Caller.m" script.

The default configuration searches for the optimal trajectory orientation and stiffness parameter by using a muscle weight vector = [-1,1,-1,1,-1,1].

The human models are automatically loaded from the dataset "robotpars.mat" and they can be replaced by any other model or set of models.

The weight muscle vector is defined in "oFCN_Human_Control_ESC.m" script in the line 99.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory "Human_Model_BBO" contains the required files to run the optimization program by using BBO.

By default, it can be performed by simply running the script "main.m" script.

The default configuration searches for the optimal trajectory orientation and stiffness parameter by using a muscle weight vector = [-1,1,-1,1,-1,1].

The human models are defined in "SOS_Flatness_OL.m" script from the line 26 to the 35 and they can be replaced by any other model.

The weight muscle vector is defined in "opt_Exercise.m" script in the line 56.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory "ESC_BBO_RESULTS" contains some results previously obtained by using the default configurations. 

The results can be plotted and viewed by running the "ESC_BBO_results.m" script in the "All Results" directory.
